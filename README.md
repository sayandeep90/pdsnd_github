### Project Title
**US Bike Share Data Analysis**

### Description
Built an interactive user project to analyse bike share data across 3 US cities - Chicago, New York City, and Washington DC

### Files used
Along with the python file bikeshare.py, we use 3 data files in csv format, for the 3 cities

### Credits
Credit needs to be given to the **Udacity course structure** which enabled me to complete this project seamlessly. The inbuilt platform also made it easy to test out code without having to worry about running each and every code locally.
